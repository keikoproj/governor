> A collection of cluster reliability tools built for Kubernetes

Governor is a collection of tools for improving the stability of the large Kubernetes clusters as a single Docker image.

Three common problems observed in large Kubernetes clusters are:

1. Node failure due to underlying cloud provider issues.
2. Pods being stuck in "Terminating" state and unable to be cleaned up.
3. Pod Disruption Budgets (PDBs) blocking node rotation/drain.
4. AWS data paths being blocked due to AZ failure.

**node-reaper** provides the capability for worker nodes to be force terminated so that replacement ones come up.
**pod-reaper** does a force termination of pods stuck in Terminating state for a certain amount of time.

In some cases, on multi-tenant platforms, users can own PDBs which block node rotation/drain if they are misconfigured, pods are in crashloop backoff, or if multiple PDBs are targeting the same pods.

**pdb-reaper** provides the capability for detecting PDBs in these conditions, and deleting them. This is especially useful for pre-production environments where pods might be left around in crashloop, or misconfigured PDBs may exist blocking node drains.

When pdb-reaper deletes PDBs, it does **NOT** recreate them, this is useful when GitOps is used. We recommend using pdb-reaper in non-production environments or use the `--dry-run` flag to have event publishing without deletion of PDBs.

There are many corner-cases where deleting PDBs might be dangerous, please consider such cases when using pdb-reaper.

**cordon** provides capabilities around cordoning specific data paths in AWS, for example excluding a specific NAT Gatway in case of AZ failure.

## Usage

Assuming an AWS-hosted running Kubernetes cluster:

```sh
kubectl create namespace governor

# Using a CronJob
kubectl apply -n governor -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keikoproj/governor/master/examples/node-reaper.yaml

kubectl apply -n governor -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keikoproj/governor/master/examples/pod-reaper.yaml

kubectl apply -n governor -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/keikoproj/governor/master/examples/pdb-reaper.yaml
```
